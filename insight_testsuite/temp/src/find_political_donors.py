## Author: Hoda Gholami
## Purpose: -To identify the areas (zip codes) that may be fertile ground for soliciting future donations for similar candidate
##          -To identify which time periods are particularly lucrative so that an analyst might later correlate them to specific fundraising events.
## Input: An input stream/file containing campaign contributions by individual donors
## Output: - An output file contains a calculated running median, total dollar amount and total number of contributions by recipient and zip code
##         - An ouput file contains a calculated median, total dollar amount and total number of contributions by recipient and date.
## Assumptions: 
## 	1. The minimum value for year is assumed to be 1975 (I got this number from FEC archived files)
##      2. I assume it is ok to preprocess the input file by removing all spaces in a line and check other validations.
##         In other word, I assumee having spaces is not considered as malformed data. And it get fixed as a preprocessing step. 
##      3. I assume that there is space between any two lines in input file. This is because I check end of file with having space and empty line.
##      4. I assume that the number of fields (21 fields) is fixed and should not change. If a line has less than 21 fields separated by "|", it will be ignored.
##      5. Based on the challenge description, we can assume the input file follows the data dictionary noted by the FEC for the 2015-current election years.
